# Style Guide

Contributions should follow this guide to ensure that they match the style and tone of the rest of the site.

## Tone

* Writing should be straightforward, simple, and direct.
* Try to write so that a middle-schooler could understand you.
* Don't use profanity or language that would be inappropriate for young children.
* A bit of humor sprinkled in is welcome in moderation.

## Paragraphs

* Keep it short and sweet.
* Use simple language so that more people can understand it.
* Try to use correct grammar, punctuation and capitalization. It's not the end of the world, but it makes things clearer, and helps people to gain trust in this guide.

## Titles

* Page titles should be `H1` elements (the biggest).
* Page titles should be in [title case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case).
* All other titles should be in [sentence case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case) (just capitalize the first letter).
* Headers should not skip levels (ie, don't use an `H3` directly under an `H1`, instead use an `H2`).
* There should only be one `H1` header per document.

## Directory listings

* Listings should start with the organization's name as a header element.
* Write a short summary (a few sentences) following the organization's name.
* Listings should include a contact section, if any contact information is known.
* Use list elements to list contact info. Provide bold labels if appropriate.
* Listings may include an `Additional Info` section following the contact section that contains another list of bullet points. This may be used for simple, informational content (like info about tax status or volunteer opportunities), not long-form text.

## Links

* While not strictly necessary, it's nice to format your links so that the text is formatted. Check out this [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for an example.

## New Files

* New files should be named using [kebab-case](https://textcaseconvert.com/blog/kebab-case/) (all lowercase, with words separated by dashes).
