# Farming the Middle Rio Grande Valley

## An open source resource guide for farmers and gardeners

This guide is intended to be an ever growing source of information for growers in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. Any one can contribute, and everyone is encouraged to provide feedback to help make the guide better.

## About

This resource guide was started by the Rio Grande Community Farm as a community resource. It is intended to be a comprehensive listing of resources for farmers, gardeners, and growers of all types in the Middle Rio Grande Valley. If you know of resources that aren't on here, please let us know!

We know that there is deep knowledge spread across our community, and so we chose to make this an open-source project, hosted on GitHub, so that the whole community can edit it. If you are interested in contributing, we have more information on our [Wiki](https://github.com/alpual/farming-the-rio-grande-valley/wiki).
